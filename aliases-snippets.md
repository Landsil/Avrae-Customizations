Those are both basic and come fancy aliases and snippets for Avrae.
You can copy whole command into discord and run it to add it.
Can be found at https://avrae.io/dashboard/aliases in either of the tabs

### Aliaes
Those are shortuts to run longer commands, you can use them instead of having a table with commands where you copy paste from.

This will make it so `!Ali` changes my character to Alistair, straight up lazines.
```yaml
!alias Ali char Alistair

```
