# Avrae-Customizations
To use most of the code here you have to login into Avrae dashboard at https://avrae.io/dashboard

- **Global Variables (gvar)**  
Let you store data for your code. Usually as JSON

- **My Customisation**  
You can store here:
  - Aliases : those are commands you can run, they can both be full commands and also re-namings/shortcuts to other commands. `!alias`
  - Snippets : those are things you can add to actions to do something eg `sneak`
  - User Variables (uvar) : Those are variables that are available only to you. This could be a list of characters stored by alias.

- **Alias Workshop**  
This is place for more serious work. Even if you don't intent to publish anything you will have to store here your bigger Aliases.
  - My Work : this is were you put your stuff. You have to make a collection and then add scripts to it.
  - My Subscriptions : Things you've enabled for yourself of your server. All of your work should always show here.


## Folders with stuff
Those are divided by usability, not by code type. What does what will be listed either here on in readme in the folder. Not everything there is made by me, some things are just useful.

### Fun
Small projects for fun, good for learning or personal usage.

- `duck.alias` Exercise in Custom Counters (CC), it gives you a bag with ducks inside and bunch of actions to perform.
- `learn.alias` This is a fun showcase of converting epoch to date time and giving user a google calendar link

### Server Tools
Bigger tools, good for learning or server wide usage. You are welcomed to self-deploy those with added customisation. 
Those will often be a re-write and/or refactors of other people's work that I improved on. If that's the case they should reference original creator in first line.

- `magictrade.alias` This is a refactor of amazing magic store Developed by topper#0294, this one is in Python, easier to read and modify.
- `underwater.alias` Auto applies fire resitance to everyone, let's you track track hodling breath and suffocating.

### Other Tools
Those things won't be Avrae and will all be self described. For eg. Public sheet that you can copy together with code that will ingest list of items and make it a JSON for usage in gvar.

### Learning
Ignore that one, nothing useful there. Most things will be either wrong or broken.
